- 👋 Hi, I’m @michaellrowley
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Engineering and Information Security!
- 🌱 I’m mainly developing projects with C#, C++, C, and (not much) Python.
- 🐰 I'm finding vulnerabilities in closed-source software at [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/michaelrowley) but most of the programs that I participate in on that site are private so you won't be able to see the vulnerabilities that I've submitted to them.
